## Update June 25th, 1:00 PM EST
Dior now closed their raffle, unfortunate. üôÅ

# Introduction
This is an open source automation script for the [Air Dior](https://www.dior.com/en_int/mens-fashion/air-dior) raffle. It was made just as a form of pracice. Have fun with it! ‚ú®

Keep in mind that you'll be getting a **QR code** via text message if you win. If you want to be serious about this, enter phone numbers into the [numbers.txt](https://github.com/rtunazzz/Diorerrr/blob/master/data/numbers.txt) file. **Without the country code (e.g. +1)**

# Modes
There are two modes.
1. <ins>**YOLO**</ins>
   - Enters with random phone numbers
2. <ins>Safe</ins>
   - Enters phone numbers specified in `data/numbers.txt` file
 
 # Setup
 [Python](https://www.python.org/) is **necessary** for you to be able to run this script.
 1. Open your terminal/command line and navigate to this directory. (You'll be using the `cd` command, a quick google search will tell you what to do if you're clueless)
 2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 3. Run `python3 main.py` on Mac, `py main.py` on Windows!
